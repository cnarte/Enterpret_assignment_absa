quite a good app but could be (much)better. here's what's wrong...

bases can't link to one another. this restriction really holds back possibilities, like, say, a single crm base (with customers, tasks, etc.) that's [ASP]share[ASP]d by any/all other bases

no offline support whatsoever. cannot even view without a connection. bummer.

it's tedious (and/or privacy-invading) to add pics/attachments. i don't want to [ASP]share[ASP] my entire icloud photo library. i do want to simply copy/paste into attachment fields!

[ASP]share[ASP] menu? also would be handy to add images, or anything, from other apps to bases via ios [ASP]share[ASP] menu

collapsible editable groupings of fields (in form view and/or table view) would be fantastic to reduce scrolling and organize 

vertical scrolling to navigate between records is a huge hassle when there are many fields. please add next/previous buttons or allow swiping sideways to navigate between records (at least as an option in settings.) !sent! Neutral

i work on a video production team, and we use airtable as our project bible. we can work on complex projects without having to worry about who’s completed what or what still needs done. it’s all there in airtable. airtable is an incredibly powerful tool. i also use it to inventory my personal music collection. love it! 

feature request: please add support for [ASP]gallery[ASP] view on ios and ipados. a number of the projects on which i work include the approval of images for use in various projects. [ASP]gallery[ASP] view is a must for these types of projects, so i can easily view the images. i currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. i would much rather use airtable for everything. plus, if [ASP]gallery[ASP] view was enabled on ios and ipados, i would undoubtedly upload more images to airtable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which i would be happily do, by the way 😉
