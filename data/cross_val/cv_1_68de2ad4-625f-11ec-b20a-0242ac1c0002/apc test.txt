i work on a video production team, and we use airtable as our project bible. we can work on complex projects without having to worry about who’s completed what or what still needs done. it’s all there in airtable. airtable is an incredibly powerful tool. i also use it to inventory my personal music collection. love it! feature request: please add support for $T$ view on ios and ipados. a number of the projects on which i work include the approval of images for use in various projects. $T$ view is a must for these types of projects, so i can easily view the images. i currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. i would much rather use airtable for everything. plus, if $T$ view was enabled on ios and ipados, i would undoubtedly upload more images to airtable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which i would be happily do, by the way 😉update: $T$ support has been added! thank you so much! it works beautifully! this is so helpful! i’ve updated my review to a much-deserved five stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
