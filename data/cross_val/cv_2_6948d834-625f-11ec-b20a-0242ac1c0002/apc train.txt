i work on a video production team, and we use airtable as our project bible. we can work on complex projects without having to worry about who’s completed what or what still needs done. it’s all there in airtable. airtable is an incredibly powerful tool. i also use it to inventory my personal music collection. love it! feature request: please add support for $T$ view on ios and ipados. a number of the projects on which i work include the approval of images for use in various projects. $T$ view is a must for these types of projects, so i can easily view the images. i currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. i would much rather use airtable for everything. plus, if $T$ view was enabled on ios and ipados, i would undoubtedly upload more images to airtable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which i would be happily do, by the way 😉update: $T$ support has been added! thank you so much! it works beautifully! this is so helpful! i’ve updated my review to a much-deserved five stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

i found this app when it became compatible with siri shortcuts. i was struggling to connect it with my shortcut and reached out to the developers for some assistance. the app itself is great. it is everything you could hope. $T$. simple and streamlined, and also capable of handling very complex and intricate applications as well. it is also cross platform so it can be truly accessible. back to my story: i was met promptly with loads of help. and when i responded with some well deserved praises, i was given some swag with a very sincere hand written thank you. i say this not so that everyone reaches out or get frustrated if you don’t get the response i did, but to point out how important this company is to the people who created this. and it was done so knowing that the user is what will help catapult the company forward by doing exactly what they have done, create an amazing product and ensuring it runs very smooth. sucheta, you rock. and thanks for your help. best wishes!
