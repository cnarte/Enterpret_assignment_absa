i discovered airtable last week and after testing it out, i love it. it’s easily customisable and replaces my reliance on a spreadsheet to maintain my inventory. the only issue is that the app is so limited. i can’t duplicate a record which is frustrating when i purchase 20 different things from the same supplier on the same date etc. this means i have to either duplicate the record on a desktop (in which case, why use the app) or i have to manually enter the same information 20 times. this is incredibly frustrating.another gripe i have is that i can’t customise the first column in the base or freeze the first two columns. a picture is very important for my inventory and i need to either customise the first column to allow addition of a picture as or freeze the first two columns so that when i scroll across, i can relate the information to the exact item. $T$ columns is available on the desktop version but not the app which means that when i’m out and about, i have to constantly scroll back and forth.there are other limitations in the app such as the inability to select multiple records to delete/copy or the lack of gallery/calendar/kanban view, but those aren’t as exasperating for me as the previous two i mentioned. it’s a shame because desktop version of airtable is an incredible tool and so versatile while the ios app is so restricted. if we were talking about the desktop version i’d give it 5 stars but for now, the ios app only gets 3.

not sure why this gets such a high rating, it’s so limited on mobile. thought i’d try airtable as an alternative to notion, but quickly found its features very limited compared with what’s advertised on their web sites front page. the lack of kanban board views is an instant killer for me. $T$ uploads also seem to get stuck and never finish if i tap the image icon, but works if i tap the 3 dots! you can’t even create formula fields on mobile. drag and dropping photos on ipad from other apps to records also doesn't seem to exist. from the brief time i’ve spent using the product i’ve just hit so many limitations, it may be great on a pc but it’s no good if mobile is your primary interface.

airtable is great because, it is simple to use with its sheet format, and it actually works on many devices - even those with older oss - ios 8 being one (that's amazing! how would people get anything done if they were strictly limited to the most updated devices?).also, it doesn't seem to be specifically built into the app, but there seems to be a way to do offline, as long as the base you want to view is left open before you go offline and viewing is all you need.suggestions:- ability to change checkbox status without having to open the specific record.- the ability to export certain records. let's say you have an active filter and you want to export just the ones you're viewing.- $T$ for mobile.

airtable is an amazing app. my company is currently starting to implement this for product tracking and it is almost the perfect tool. i’ve rated the app 3 stars for 2 reasons:no gallery view in app-the ability to switch between views is the main reason we use airtable instead of excel. having an app version (that has a zoom option) would make this a 4 star app. no $T$ viewing mode- the collaborative nature of this program is amazing. i realize solving discrepancies is the main reason for not having an $T$ mode. however, we use this mainly for a visual representation of our products. if we are in a building with bad signal or traveling overseas, it would be ideal to at least have a “last saved version” to reference photos $T$. $T$ viewing mode would make this a 5 star app.i will immediately revise this review if gallery view is added to the app and if an $T$ viewing mode is added.thanks

don’t get me wrong, airtable is a great platform, but promising everything is misleading. everything requires numerous bolt on integrations that cost our company an extra $175/month. the $T$ integration helps a ton. however it’s missing several vital triggers. like detecting an updated record. thus the workaround is a $49/per month patch “plug in” by a 3rd party. $T$ claims they have been requesting this of airtable to enable this for many many months. come on airtable. please don’t make us pay hundreds of dollars more per month to enable features that airtable could certainly provide. another missing function (which would not require a zap), allowing customers to update their own record requires a 3rd party integration to simply create a unique url to a unique form for external updating. airtable developers could flip a switch to get these “basics” enabled.
