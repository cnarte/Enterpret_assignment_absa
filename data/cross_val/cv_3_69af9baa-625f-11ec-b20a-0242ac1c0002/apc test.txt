tried adding a column of numbers. trying to calculate a payroll. with supplemental hours etc. gas, parking, etc.can't just add up a column without creating additional tables. $T$. and then the videos they have on their web site. seriously - how about a way of freezing the video so we can follow the steps. watched one video; i had to watch it 20 times at least so i could follow the steps. i know, it's not supposed to be excel. i get it. still too complicated to just add up how much i am supposed to be reimbursed for my mileage, parking etc. but hey, not all bad - i haven't torn out all my hair - yet.in conclusion - still room for improvement. think i will just look for an excel type product.
