i found this app when it became compatible with siri shortcuts. i was struggling to connect it with my shortcut and reached out to the developers for some assistance. the app itself is great. it is everything you could hope. $T$. simple and streamlined, and also capable of handling very complex and intricate applications as well. it is also cross platform so it can be truly accessible. back to my story: i was met promptly with loads of help. and when i responded with some well deserved praises, i was given some swag with a very sincere hand written thank you. i say this not so that everyone reaches out or get frustrated if you don’t get the response i did, but to point out how important this company is to the people who created this. and it was done so knowing that the user is what will help catapult the company forward by doing exactly what they have done, create an amazing product and ensuring it runs very smooth. sucheta, you rock. and thanks for your help. best wishes!
