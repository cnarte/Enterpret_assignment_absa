smeac
• situation

• administration 
• [ASP]communication[ASP] 

i’m able to use exactly the same with asana and get the same results in my business. quickly, efficiently and as part of a team (without any blood stains or missing persons reporting).

i have 259 different apps between my iphone and ipad. if i could only keep 3; 
• notability
• asana 
• my car key would be it (it would just be too expensive smashing the window every time i needed in the car).

i hope you guys have won awards! 🏆 you have certainly deserved it.
